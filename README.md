## Dry Beans Classification Final

Dry bean cultivation is practiced in Turkey and Asian countries usually in the form of populations containing
mixed species of seeds. As different populations containing different genotypes are cultivated, the final products
contain different species of seeds.

The purpose of this project is to explore the potential of the various learning methods and give a recommendation
on which type of algorithm we should further develop for the task of sorting white beans. In doing so, we will
develop an automated method that predicts the value of a harvest from a ‘population cultivation’ from a single
farm that has been presented at market. Since each of the beans has a different value at market. the cost
of an error depends on the actual type of white bean, and it’s predicted class.

The algorithm selection will be based on the algorithm that produces the highest accuracy in classifying the bean
type. The algorithm with the highest classification accuracy will serve to minimize the market value cost of
classification errors between dry bean varieties.
